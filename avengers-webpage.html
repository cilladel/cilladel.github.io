    <p2>The Avengers are a group of superheroes who use their strength and power <br>
    to save cities, people, and even the world from evil forces trying to destroy them. <br>
    Their group was formed by Nick Fury, who worked for SHIELD. The Avengers tended to fight <br>
    against aliens, the most well-known of which was Thanos, who, at first, succeeded in wiping <br>
    out one third of the population, until the Avengers were able to regroup and defeat him.

    <p3>There is much controversy over whether or not the Avengers should be better kept in check. <br>
    This was first addressed when Marvel produced the Captain America: Civil War movie. In this movie, <br>
    the Avengers became divided because some agreed to sign the Sokovia Accords, causing the Avengers to be <br>
    more restricted in their actions and decisions, while others refused. The two sides, Captain America versus <br>
    Iron Man, have valid points to their arguments. Captain America argues that, if they sign the Accords, <br>
    they will no longer have the liberty to freely choose to go help someone, and they may be hindered from intervening<br>
    when needed, and they could be used for evil, by those controlling them. However, Iron Man is grieved by all the deaths <br>
    they have inadvertantly caused, and he thinks that the Avengers do need to be kept in check. For more insight <br>
    into this argument, here is a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/captain-america-vs-iron-man-whos-right-in-marvels-civil-war-2018-4" target=_blank>link</a> to an article about this argument.
